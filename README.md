# Public library data map

This project collects and maps data from public libraries across the Australia and the external Territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

You should be able to find the location of every public library in Australia territory, plus the standard loan period for each libary service, and whether they charge overdue fines (if known, in both cases).

Check out the map at [librarymap.hugh.run](https://librarymap.hugh.run).
