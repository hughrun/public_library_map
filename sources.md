### Library services

The library service boundaries are derived from local government boundary data care of PSMA and accessed from [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au).

Data about fines and lending periods is a mix of original research, plus data provided by State Libraries and Public Libraries Victoria.

Data about Integrated Library Systems (ILS) is mostly original research, with some data from State Library of Queensland, and some checked at Marshall Breeding's [librarytechnology.org](http://librarytechnology.org) site.
