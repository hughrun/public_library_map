### Library services

The library service boundaries are derived from local government boundary data care of PSMA and accessed from [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au). 

Data about fines and lending periods is a mix of original research, plus data provided by State Libraries and Public Libraries Victoria.

Data about language holdings (TODO) provided by various sources.

Data about Integrated Library Systems (ILS) (TODO - almost done) is mostly original research, with some data from State Library of Queensland, and some checked at Marshall Breeding's [librarytechnology.org](http://librarytechnology.org) site.
